## Description

# Humble Superhero API

Welcome to the **Humble Superhero API** project! This API lets you manage a list of superheroes by adding their names, superpowers, and humility scores. The superheroes are ordered by their humility score in descending order to highlight the humblest of the heroes.

## Objective

The goal of this API is to create a backend that allows users to:
1. Add a new superhero with their name, superpower, and humility score.
2. Fetch a sorted list of superheroes based on their humility score.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Built using **NestJS** version 10
- **frontend**: ReactJS
- **Database**: Simple in-memory storage (an array) for superhero data
- **API**: Two main endpoints to handle superhero data:
  - `POST /superheroes`: Adds a new superhero.
  - `GET /superheroes`: Fetches the superheroes sorted by humility score.
  Example : 'http://localhost:3000/superheroes' for POST/GET

## Endpoints

### POST /superheroes
**Description**: Adds a new superhero to the list.

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "name": "Superman",
  "superpower": "Flight",
  "humilityScore": 10
}
```

### GET /superheroes
**Description**: To get superhero list.

**Response**:
```json
[
    {
        "name": "Superman",
        "superpower": "Flight",
        "humilityScore": 10
    },
    {
        "name": "Hero2",
        "superpower": "Flying",
        "humilityScore": 8
    },
    {
        "name": "Hero3",
        "superpower": "Speed",
        "humilityScore": 1
    }
]
```
### For Testing

```bash
$ npm run test
```
## If I had more time...

If I had more time, I would explore the following improvements:

1. **Persistent Database**: Replace the in-memory storage with a database (e.g., **MongoDB** or **PostgreSQL**) to persist superhero data across server restarts.

2. **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement a simple authentication system (e.g., **JWT** or **OAuth**) to ensure that only authorized users can manage superheroes.

3. **Frontend**: Build a **React frontend** to allow users to:
    - Add more frontend validation for all fields.
   - Display success/error messages.
   - 
4. **Advanced Validation**: Add validation for:
   - Unique superhero names.
   - Non-empty superpower strings.

5. **Unit and Integration Testing**: Write more comprehensive tests, covering:
   - Edge cases and integration tests.
   - Performance testing for large datasets.

6. **Error Handling and Logging**: Enhance error handling and implement logging using tools like **Winston** or **Pino** to track issues in production.

7. **Deployment**: Deploy the API to a cloud platform (e.g., **Heroku** or **AWS**) for public access.

8. **API Rate Limiting and Caching**: Implement **rate limiting** and **caching** (e.g., **Redis**) to improve performance and prevent abuse.
